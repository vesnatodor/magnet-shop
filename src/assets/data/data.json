        "text": "Magnets are bodies that create a magnetic field and attract objects of iron and other ferromagnetic materials. Magnetic field - we are in it. Are you sure you want an explanation? Each planet in the solar system has its own magnetic field. We are actually in the Earth's magnetosphere. Namely, the magnetic envelope i.e. the magnetosphere is the area of ​​space around the planet,which it controls the magnetic field of the planet Earth.<br> Our planet acts with magnetic force how to plant and the animal world as well as us humans. Without the magnetic field,we would not exist. Let's have a look what is actually behind it. the latest studies published on this topic clearly prove that people and also other creatures can sense the magnetic field.<br> It seems that certain bacteria, snails, frogs (on which carry out various experiments on the subject of magnets and magnetic fields) and hawks discover the earth's magnetic field. Everything becomes a lot more interesting when there is information that some animals like migratory birds even rely on it."

        "text": "The unit of measurement of magnetic induction is Gauss, symbol G (sometimes Gs), is also known as the magnetic flux density. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter. The unit is part of the Gaussian system of units, which inherited it from the older CGS-EMU system. It was named after to the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friendrich Gauss in 1936. There is another unit for measuring the magnetic field. It's a Tesla and it's 10000G. Unfortunately, it has been scientifically proven that the magnetic field weakens over time. This phenomenon is indirectly reflected on every living organism on the planet. Only 500 years ago, the strength of the magnetic field in our country was 1 Gauss per cm2 and now it is half as much."

        "text": "The Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing, and so is the way it changes. When describing the Earth's magnetic field, we must determine both the direction and intensity of the field. Since both change and change differently in different places, it is not easy to say how it changes the earth's field as a whole. Due to the complexity of the Earth's magnetic field and constant changes, it is impossible to predict what the field will be like in the future. Depending on the geographical latitude, the strength of the earth's magnetic field varies. It is strongest around the poles and weakest in Ecuador. The field strength on the Earth's surface ranges from less than 30 microtesla (0.3 Gauss) in an area that includes most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microtesla (0.6 Gauss) around the magnetic poles in northern Canada and southern Australia, and in part of Siberia. In our area, a magnetic field of half a gauss passes through each of us."

        "text": "There are places on the planet that are known to have a beneficial effect on health. Strong magnetic fields were measured in those places. One of them is Naidan's circles Mali Krsna on the territory of the municipality of Smederevo. Namely, in 1999, radiologist Najdan Rakić found a place in the shape of a circle with a diameter of 7m. Because of its healing effect, Mala Krsna is now also called Suva Banja. There are records that indicate to the fact that people were treated in the same place in 1713. Science does not yet have an answer to this phenomenon while radioestheticians claim that it is a place with strong positive radiation. It is a natural phenomenon that requires more research. It was confirmed that there are absolutely no bad ones torture for man. One of the wisdom is to come to places like this and expose yourself to what God and nature have given."

        "title": "Magnetic therapy",
        "text": "Magnetic therapy is a painless and extremely simple therapy that has no side effects and the reaction if the optimal strength of the magnetic field is used to stimulate body cells. During long-term, several-hour or several-day therapies of certain parts of the body, the magnetic field should not be stronger than 800 Gauss units. Magnets act on the body by accelerating movement and providing energy leukocytes stimulate cells in the body to regenerate faster, and improve blood flow of blood in the body, which contributes to faster healing of inflammatory processes and general strengthening of immunity. When a person has a certain injury on the body or tissue damage, he puts the magnet close to him. Positively the charged ions go towards the injured area and help to restore it to normal electromagnetic balance. The therapy itself is well tolerated, does not cause discomfort and is absolutely safe. What magnetic therapy what makes it special is that the magnets themselves are very resistant and their rays penetrate through any type of surface. If the person using the magnets has a cast, bandage or longet, the rays will easily penetrate through them, which is why this therapy can be used in almost everything health situations and conditions. Magnetic therapy has both general and local effects, so I can use it and those who want to improve the general condition of the organism, but also and people who want to heal a specific organ. Since ancient times, traditional medicine has been based on the use of various methods for stimulating bioactives points in the body to stimulate the work of vital organs. Magnets act in a similar way way due to the fact that they have a stimulating effect on nerve endings, that is, bioactive points, by they reach the very membranes of blood cells, which accelerates the regrouping of ions and allows them to flow freely movement through the body. This way of movingprevents blood platelets from colliding and sticking together, and in addition, it slows down the deposition of cholesterol in them, which preserves the health of blood vessels. Magnetic therapy is active because of all the above-mentioned properties used to treat a wide range of diseases."
